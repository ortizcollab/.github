## Submitting changes

Please send a pull request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability...
